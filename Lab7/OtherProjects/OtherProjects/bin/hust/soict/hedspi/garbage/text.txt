The storyteller folds her slender hands - both pairs - and speaks. “It happened an age ago. But when I recall, I see it true.” So begins the tale of the Shattering, a devastating war between the children of Marika, Demigods of the Lands Between. One grim night in the depths of winter, a flock of unknown assassins stole across the Lands Between.

In a coetaneous attack, this foul covenant snuffed out the lives of many of the God-Queen’s kin throughout the empire, too numerous and too scattered for her godly protection to save. The assassins’ targets were multifold, but none was as devastating a loss to the Eternal Queen as that of Godwyn the Golden. After his death, the Elden Ring was somehow shattered, and the order of the world broke with it.

Out of this chaos came war. Open, bitter war, pitting blood against blood and kin against kin. The conflict broke a vast and prosperous empire into brittle fragments. No single side could find enough purchase to maintain a decisive victory, even when fueled by the power of a Great Rune.

The battle of General Radahn against Malenia the Severed illustrated that neither strength nor skill alone would be enough to take control of the entirety of the lands Marika had united. And so, the Lands Between are no longer gripped by open war, but caught in an uneasy stalemate that seems impossible to resolve. “Unless of course,” the storyteller says, a coy smile on both her lips, “thou shouldst take the crown?”

Take a deeper dive into the carefully crafted mythology of George R.R. Martin – author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire – and the world created by FromSoftware based on his work in this new trailer available here.

Transported to ages long ago, you will relive the Shattering, a war that brought darkness to the Lands Between, initiated by demigods’ hunger for power. You’ll fight alongside General Radahn and Malenia the Severed, but even these two undefeatable warriors couldn’t reunite a world so badly broken. There is only one hope left: the hope that a new Elden Lord will rise and lift the veil of shadows that has fallen over Marika’s domain.

The wait is almost over. Soon you’ll venture into the Lands Between and strive to become its Elden Lord. Stand ready, Tarnished, and prepare to claim what fate has promised you.What is the timeline of the Lands Between? Has it been one fairly linear timeline, or is it in a constant state of cyclical flux?
Is there one Erdtree that arose after the ages of the Giants and Dragons or have there been several cycles with different Erdtrees after intervening cycles of rule by the Giants, Dragons, Tarnished, etc.?
Was there a war with the dragons both long ago and after the founding of the Golden Order and the defeat of the Giants, or does the ambiguous nature of their timeline reflect the special association between the Dragons and the storm outside of time?
How do New Game Plus instances tie into the timeline? Are they a repeat cycle after your rule as Elden Lord and then another cycle of the Golden Order, or is it just a channel back in time to the beginning of the game?
What exactly is the Elden Ring? 
Is it a symbolic measure of power or dominance over the Erdtree specifically; a symbolic representation of any Outer God-level power that achieves dominance over the Lands Between; an actual artifact of power that becomes controlled by the Elden Lord; or perhaps a form assumed by the Elden Beast in order to effectuate the goals of the Greater Will?
Why did Marika ultimately decide to shatter it after Godwyn's death? Was it in order to drive Godfrey out of the lands Between and initiate the Long March of the Tarnished?
What is Marika?
Is Marika the Godhood vested into the Lands Between if the Elden Ring is created under the influence of the Greater Will or is she a specific entity within the most recent iterations of the Lands Between? In relation to the timeline questions posed above: is the world in endless cycles of domination by various Outer Gods who create a "Marika" as the assert their rule over the Lands Between; is it only whe the Greater Will dominates the Lands Between that a "Marika" is created; or did Marika come to the Lands Between one or two cycles before our Tarnished, get elevated to Godhood in conjunction with Godfrey, then ultimately break the ring?
If Marika is a specific being rather than an element of the Golden Order or a symbol of the current Elden Ring, then how did Marika come to the Lands Between and why? Was she called from the lands of the Numen similar to how the Tarnished are recalled to the Lands Between (and if so by what), or did she come for some other reason? Was she associated with the Greater Will from the outset or did she become its ally for some reason?
How did she become an Empyrian (as implied by Godfrey's ascension to Elden Lord upon their marriage) and/or why did the Two Fingers select her?
What is the nature of the Radagon Marika dynamic?
Is Radagon a separate being? If so, was Radagon born separate from Marika--either as her offspring with Godfrey or as a totally separate lineage--and then merged into Marika, or was he split off from Marika at some point in time and then either re-incorporated or co-imprisoned with her in the Erdtree? Does the red hair of the Giants imply that Radagon was split off from Marika as a result of the curse of the Giants? (which Radagon seems to be attempting to enforce against Marika based on his attempts to mend the Elden Ring and his defense of the Elden Beast within the Erdtree)?
Or is Radagon simply another form assumed by Marika and why? In order to take action as something other than Marika or as a manifestation of an alternate personality?
How many Outer Gods are there and how do they tie into the timeline questions posed above? How many Empyrians have there been, and what does this imply for the relationship between the Two Fingers and the Greater Will and/or other Outer Gods?
What are the Two Fingers? Do the dead Two Fingers atop most of the Sacred Towers represent separate instances of a single Two Fingers that has left dead "clones" around the Lands Between or is each Two Fingers (and/or three fingers) an independent entity attempting to cultivate future cycles for the Elden Ring by selecting and guiding specific Empyrians and candidates for Elden Lord?
What is the Erdtree and why is its sap/amber so powerful? Why do all of the catecombs end in a room where bodies of the dead are being sucked into the roots and ember of (seemingly) the Erdtree?
It is possible that the Golden Order is really nothing more than the Greater Will's diversion of the souls of the dead into the Erdtree, allowing the Will to effectively harvest the life-force of the Lands Between to power the domination of the Golden Order over Death itself.
What is the deal with the Night of Black Knives?
Was the treachery that cause the subterranean kingdoms to be pushed underground the Night of Black Knives or was the Night of Black Knives a response to the destruction of their city by Astel? If the night is the treachery, then why did Nox initiate the plot in the first place? Did the experimentation with the Silver Tears pre-date or post-date the sinking event?
Why was Ranni involved in the plot the Night of the Black Knives, and to what extent? Is she the mastermind behind the plot (as implied by Rogier) or did she merely perform the ritual to create the Black Knives? Is there some Carian connection to the Nox of Nokron and Nokstella? Have there been other attempts to overthrow the Golden Order, and if so how does this tie into the timeline questions above?
Ranni, Rennalla, Caria, and the Stars
What is the deal with the puppets in the hidden basement behind the Carian Manor, where there are puppets of a Nox, an Omenkiller, Dolores the Sleeping Arrow, Finger Maiden Therolina, a Jarwright, and, hidden behind a wall, Sellen. Are these all Seluvis' puppets as implied by much of the lore associated with the puppet summons, but if so why would he put a sign up not to touch one in particular?
Omenkiller may have been to frame Gideon Ofnir for the slaughter in the village of the Albinuriacs, which leads to Nephali becoming disillusioned and susceptible to the puppet potion. Is Pidia on a personal mission here (seems so because the puppet dropped by Pidia doesn't seem to affect any game outcome other than locking out Dung Eater or Nephali's quest lines, and only Dung Eater, an unintended target, locks out an ending) or is this part of some greater plan?
Given the connection between Ranni, Seulvis, and Pidia have to the puppets, as well as the existence of several Nox puppets, did Ranni frame the Nox civilization for the Night of the Black Knives? If not, why does she want the Fingerslayer Blade recovered from Nokron? She doesn't seem to use it in the Age of Stars ending, so did she use it to kill the fingers creature we find at the cathedral of Manus Celes or something else? Note that Pidia is immediately killed by his soldier puppets, implying that Ranni killed something that was aiding Pidia/Seluvis, but why would the fingers be assisting those two?
If they're all Seluvis's puppets, then what is the implication of finding out that Seluvis himself was a puppet? (Note that Seluvis collapses into the puppet pose once Pidia is killed after giving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade.) Was he a puppet dominated by Pidia or was he controlled by his own disembodied form like Ranni?
Ranni is also a puppet, so is she being controlled by her spirit (which we are told lived following her death on the night of the black knives) or is someone else masquerading as her? She seems to survive Pidia's death, so we can infer it wasn't him, but who then?
If the puppets are to frame people (as potentially implied by Thops' disbelief that Sellen could have done the things the Graven Witch was accused of doing and the note about Seluvis' secret) then what are they trying to accomplish? Is that even right given the ending to Sellen's questline?
In the opening of the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021, we see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying "The Tarnished, will soon return." The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simply put, you are the Tarnished. As the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing of Grace granted by the Elden Ring and the Erdtree, a tree that hosts source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like previous Souls games, where you are the Chosen Undead or the Ashen One. After the shattering of the Elden Ring, you are then called back by this lost Grace to The Lands Between, along with other Tarnished to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the Elden Lord of The Lands Between.

According to Hidetaka Miyazaki in an interview: " I feel like one of the main themes of the game is how the player, the Tarnished, approaches or treats this new-found grace and this return to the land that they were once banished from, how they interpret this and the meaning. It's not just the player-character, of course, it's lots of characters in the game, who are all beckoned back and will have their own adventures and motives. We want the player to discover for themselves what that means and how they want to begin their adventure."

 

THE LANDS BETWEEN
lore image1 elden ring wik guide 300px

 

The Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace; they were exiled and labeled the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered and its shards were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest of these pieces were called Great Runes and were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal, causing them to inherit different powers and have been physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power of these runes.

The Lands Between is divided into 7 distinct areas,

Limgrave
Caelid 
Liurnia of the Lakes 
Altus Plateau 
Mt. Gelmir
Mountaintops of the Giants
The River Kingdoms (underground) 
Each overseen by a Demigod, and features a central "overworld" that connects all of these areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle for each area, and it is up to the player on how they want to approach it. The hub area similar to Firelink Shrine or Majula in previous games will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.

According to Hidetaka Miyazaki: "The Lands Between is supposed to invoke this feeling of something that's very mysterious and very ethereal – and we hope that when players play the game, they're going to experience that."

 

 

LORE THEORIES OF ELDEN RING
This section is dedicated to speculative and theoretical content created by the Elden Ring community. The information therein may be based on in-game fact and real world myths, but all theory pieces are simply the interpretation of the user(s) that wrote them and not canon.

Some of the main questions posed by the lore of the Lands Between:

What is the timeline of the Lands Between? Has it been one fairly linear timeline, or is it in a constant state of cyclical flux?
Is there one Erdtree that arose after the ages of the Giants and Dragons or have there been several cycles with different Erdtrees after intervening cycles of rule by the Giants, Dragons, Tarnished, etc.?

Here is a list of possible attempts to overthrow the Greater Will. Note that for the most part all of these are merely plausible theories and may or may not be proven in the future.

Hewg the Blacksmith was assigned by Queen Marika to create a weapon that could slay "God" but was not able to do so in time:
"Queen Marika, please forgive me, I haven't made a weapon that could kill God yet" - Hewg the Blacksmith

Nokron the Eternal City succeeded in creating the above mentioned weapon but was immediately accused of treason, resulting in its destruction and banishing below the earth.

Marika "created" Melina and gave her the mission to burn down the Erdtree.
Melina got lost and forgot about her mission, wandering around the Lands Between in search for her purpose.
Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless." - Melina

The Shattering of the Ring: It is suspected that Marika did not destroy the Elden Ring out of rage over Godwyn's death. It is possible that his death merely awakened her, barely giving back enough sanity to destroy the Elden Ring in an attempt to find the strongest of the champions for them to claim the power of the Great Runes and become Elden Lord (or at least free her from her suffering).
The war however, did not conclude in a winner as Radahn and Malenia proofed to be equal in strength.

Marika used the last shimmer of grace to invite even the Tarnished to fight for the Great Runes and become Elden Lord, even granting them revival upon death (Or something like that? I mean we are still dying in the game).
The Greater Will is trying to hinder this plan by blocking the Tarnished with the roots of the Erdtree.
Whether this plan succeeds is up to the player to find out.

SPOILERS FOR ELDEN RING

Theory: Elden Ring has multiple time lines: The God of Chaos Ending results you starting the age of ancients and burning the world away to set the stage for the emergence of humanity.

If you chose to burn the world away, destroying the golden order and the vast majority of life in the Lands Between if not all of the Lands Between itself. Remember back to the first lines of the series:
"In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.
But then there was fire, and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.
Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame."

Your soul as the god of chaos was split. Your fire nearly dies out after ravaging the world down to arch trees and the stone dragons. You, with your new burning circle head for a head; smolder out. Your God of Chaos Elden Lord becomes the Pigmy, with your head now bearing the dark sign, a smoldered out ring of fire. You shift to becoming weaker as Gwyn takes your power and splits it to destroy the dragons and binds your soul to humanity and the last embers of your power. Your soul burns, until your descendants refuse can no longer light the fires or no longer care and let the wild chaos of your soul; The Abyss, creep into the Age of Dark.

Here's a theory I've come up with: Status effects scale with Arcane because that attribute represents your character's insight into and ability to make use of the eldritch influences in the Lands Between. If you think about it, every status effect seems to be tied to some Outer God. This is most obvious with Madness, which is related to the Flame of Frenzy, and Scarlet Rot, although we don't have a name for that Outer God. But Hemorrhage is also stated to somehow please the Formless Mother, while Sleep is associated with St. Trina/Miquella, who presumably is a vessel for an Outer God like his sister Malenia. Frostbite is connected to Ranni and the unnamed moon entity she establishes her new order with, whereas Death Blight might have something to do with the Death Birds. Poison is the least clear, but serpents seem to be associated with it. Perhaps the one that Rykard fed himself to? Anyway, it's pretty interesting to think about.
